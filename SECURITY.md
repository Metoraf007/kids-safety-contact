# Security Considerations

- Do not commit secrets or personal data.
- Prefer a dedicated contact number you can rotate.
- Consider a short custom domain with HTTPS-only.
- If you add analytics, ensure IP anonymization and no third-party tracking.
- Keep third-party links (WhatsApp, tel:) restricted to intent actions.
